			<h1>Child Hope Field Of Dreams Children's Charity Foundation</h1>
			<section class="underline"></section>
			<p>Child Hope Field Of Dreams Children's Charity Foundation or more commonly called 'Field of Dreams' is a nonprofit organaization/charity in Davao City, Philippines which is centered around providing aid for youth boys. The first reason why I encourage you to support this charity is because of the diversity of their services, where they range from providing basic needs to teaching independence to youth boys. The second reason why I encourage you to support is because of their engagement in the local community. This is shown through the fact that most of boys that they have taken in are local homeless children. The final reason is their reliability and the consistency of their work. They have served continually and, ultimately, have repeatedly benefited society. If you're interested in joining me in supporting this cause, you can sign up by entering your information in the right.</p>
